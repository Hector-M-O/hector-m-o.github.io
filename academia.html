                <p>Héctor received his PhD in Creative Writing from 
                    <a href="https://www.dcu.ie/" target="_blank">Dublin City University</a> 
                    in 2024. Proposed and developed as a PhD by artifact, 
                    the two-part thesis explored the question of how characters based on historical figures are created in fiction from both creative and theoretical perspectives. 
                    The creative component was a historical novel, <i>My Name is John Tyndall</i>, based on the life of the eponymous Irish scientist 
                    while incorporating significant fictional innovations. The critical component was a dissertation examining the relationship between 
                    historical figures and their fictional representations in Hilary Mantel's widely acclaimed Cromwell trilogy.
                </p>
                <p>Héctor has lectured in creative writing at Dublin City University and Boston University, and his research is forthcoming in academic journal 
                    <a href="https://read.dukeupress.edu/poetics-today" target="_blank">Poetics Today</a>. 
                    He has received funding from Dublin City University's 
                    <a href="https://www.dcu.ie/english" target="_blank">School of English</a> 
                    and from the 
                    <a href="https://hanse-ias.de/en/" target="_blank">Hanse-Wissenschaftskolleg - Institute for Advanced Study</a>,
                    where he is currently the Fellow Writer in Residence.
                </p>
                <p>His research interests include creative writing, literary characters, historical fiction, 
                    and the phenomenon of immersion/narrative absorption, all analysed within the frame of cognitive narratology.
                </p>
